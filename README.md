## Getting and Cleaning Data Programming Assignment

This repository holds my programming assignment for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The task for the assignment is to create a summary data set that holds the means of the mean() and std() columns by subject and activity from the Human Activity Recognition using Smartphones Dataset hosted by the UCI Data Repository: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
